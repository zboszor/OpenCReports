			Variables are aliases for either basic or iterative
			expressions.
		</para>
		<para>
			For basic expressions, the value of a variable is
			calculated from the aliased expression using the current
			row of data from the data source. This can be thought of
			as a kind of shortcut. A variable calculates the
			value of a long or often used expression, and the variable
			in turn can be used in other expressions. The can save
			both typing (in the report XML) or runtime during the
			report generation, since the expression value is calculated
			once per row.
		</para>
		<para>
			Iterative variables use both the values of the current row
			of data and the value of the variable calculated for the
			previous row. Such use case are counting values (with either
			accounting or ignoring NULL values), summing or averaging
			values, or calculating the highest or lowest value of the
			dataset.

			Variables may be reset at break boundaries.

		<para>
			Custom variables may be defined that use any supported
			data type and custom accumulator functions.
