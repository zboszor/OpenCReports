		<title>Introduction to report breaks</title>
		<para>
			It is often necessary to group data by certain properties.
			Imagine a list of employees of a company, grouped by their
			departments, pay grade, or location of employment. A report
			may show the list of the employees with visual separation
			according to any of these properties.
		</para>
		<para>
			Such grouping (properties of distinction) may co-exist in
			a report with prioritization: first by department, then
			in each department, subgrouping would separate employees
			according to the pay grade, etc.
